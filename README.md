## About the data

1- State_Drug_Utilization_Data_2010

  - In this folder you will find a dataset with the same name as its folder taken from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/state-drug-utilization-data-2010-81ad0) catalog. The data are significantly reduced from its original size. Included in the folder is a Jupyter Notebook file called "read_&_sample_data.ipynb" which shows how the data were sampled. Feel free to visit the data.gov and [direct download the entire CSV version](https://data.medicaid.gov/api/views/mmgn-kvy5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) of the sampled dataset. 

2- baseballdatabank-master

  - These data are collected from [Sean Lahman](http://www.seanlahman.com/about/) including the latest CSV format version. There are two folders inside the 'baseballdatabank-master' folder, the 'core' folder and the 'upstream' folder. In the 'core' folder are located most of the database tables formated as CSV files, plus a 'readme' text file explaining the tables. The 'upstream' folder contains the 'Teams.csv' table. You can [download the latest version](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) of the data into your own local machine directly from Sean's site.
